========
output simply. Get rid of the multiple outputs and index stuff in gnuplot script. Can we pipe stdout to gnuplot?
output array 
implement ppm.
final index of output?
x/t graphs?



26/03/16
========
bug found in flux
next:

implement ppm or weno?

extend to 2D
generalise to fluid solver 
function pointers?
inheritance?

1d plasticity (necessary to do this for write up)

tv Travel Man:


19/03/16
========
getting the correct-ish results but is slow
profile and compare against kevin's code. (disable openmp) - kcachegrind (done this recently)
euler angles

vector calc
differential geometry







18/03/16
========
1D ghost-fluid
x/t diagrams
compare speeds to group code
solver class
levelsets 
implement godunov state solution  
2D curl boundary condition
Templated tensor class

TODO:
=====
create a .gnuplotrc file
MPI functionality (remove openMP)
generalise solvers (WAF, MUSCL, SLIC etc)

level-sets
  --1D method 
  --signed distance function generation
  --arbitrary shapes
  --boundary conditions: slip/stick/weld

05/05/14
========
reformatted slic code, ready to start on riemann solution
switched to branch riemannTwo
